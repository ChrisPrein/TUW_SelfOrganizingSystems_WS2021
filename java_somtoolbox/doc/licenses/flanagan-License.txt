Permission to copy:
A large number of individuals have requested copies of this library. Consequently I have made it available, as a jar file (see below), with the qualifation that it is written to suport a course that I lecture. Though I believe it is professionally written, it is not a commercial product and the methods are not necessarily as all embracing as might be found in a commercial product nor are they checked to be fault free in all possible foreseable situations as would be, or at least ought to be, in a commercial product; you use this library at your own risk and more formally:
