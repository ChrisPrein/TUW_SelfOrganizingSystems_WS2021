  <h1>SOM Network Models</h1>
  <p>The Java SOMToolbox provides implementations of several self-organising network models</p>

      <p>The Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM) is an extension of the original SOM algorithm that modifies the
      network topology such that it can grow both in map size and in depth. The training algorithm automatically selects the most
      fitting hierarchical structure for a given data set. The GHSOM provides a structural representation that is rough on the first
      layer and can be zoomed into if the fine details are of interest. It has been applied to various document databases, where the
      most similar articles are grouped together. <a href="http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~andi/ghsom/" class="detail">[Details]</a></p>

    <h2>Mnemonic SOM</h2>

    <div class="maintab-content">
    The mnemonic SOM is an adaption of the original SOM algorithm that utilisizes non-rectangular
    shapes. The idea is to present to the user shapes, such as country or continent maps, or geometrical shapes such as icons,
    he is familiar with. This will allow an easier description of the location of certain data items, and provides an
    additional mnemonic clue for remembering the locations and relationships between clusters.<br/>

    <h2>Growing Grid</h2>

    <div class="maintab-content">
      <p>The Growing Grid is a self-organizing network which is generated by a growth process. The application range of
      the model is the same as for Kohonen's feature map: generation of topology-preserving and dimensionality-reducing mappings, e.g.,
      for the purpose of data visualization. The network structure is a rectangular grid which, however, increases its size during
      self-organization. By inserting complete rows or columns of units the grid may adapt its height/width ratio to the given pattern
      distribution. Both the neighborhood range used to co-adapt units in the vicinity of the winning unit and the adaptation strength
      are constant during the growth phase. This makes it possible to let the network grow until an application-specific performance
      criterion is fulfilled or until a desired network size is reached. A final approximation phase with decaying adaptation strength
      fine-tunes the network.</p>

    <div class="maintab-content">
      <p>The Growing Cell Structures are a self-organizing neural network model that performs unsupervised learning and can be used
      for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches, e.g., the Kohonen
      feature map, is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a
      controlled growth process which also includes occasional removal of units. This architecture is not anymore based on a rectangular
      structure; instead, the units are arranged in triangles, with each unit having at least two connections to neighbouring units.</p>
